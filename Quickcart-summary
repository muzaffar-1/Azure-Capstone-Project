## 📂 Project Tasks  

### **Task 1 – Local Environment Setup**
- Installed Visual Studio, .NET SDK, Node.js, Angular CLI, and Git.  
- Cloned frontend and backend repos from Azure Repos.  
- Tested both locally to ensure smooth API and frontend communication.  

🟢 *Result:* Verified the application functionality locally before cloud deployment.  

---

### **Task 2 – Deploy Backend to Azure**
- Created an **App Service Plan** and **Web App** for backend deployment.  
- Configured **Azure SQL Database** for product, order, and user data.  
- Integrated **Azure Blob Storage** for product images with **lifecycle management** to reduce cost.  
- Built a **CI pipeline** in Azure DevOps to build and publish artifacts.  

🟢 *Result:* Backend deployed successfully on Azure App Service.  

---

### **Task 3 – Continuous Deployment (Classic Release Pipeline)**
- Built a **multi-stage Release pipeline** with **Test** and **Production** stages.  
- Added **pre-deployment approvals** to both stages for manual confirmation before deployment.  
- Configured a **post-deployment gate** (Azure Monitor + Application Insights) to check for failed requests before promotion.  
- Set **manual approval (5 min timeout)** for Production deployment.  
- Used **Azure Key Vault** + **Managed Identity** for secure DB connection strings.  
- Deployed **Angular frontend** on **Azure Static Web App** pointing to backend APIs.  

🟢 *Result:* Automated, secure CI/CD pipeline with approvals and monitoring.  

---

### **Task 4 – Login Functionality using Azure Function**
- Developed a **C# Azure Function** with an **HTTP trigger** for user login.  
- Integrated the Function endpoint with the Angular frontend.  
- Enabled **CORS** and monitored function activity via **Application Insights**.  

🟢 *Result:* Scalable, serverless login service successfully deployed.  

---

## 🧠 Key Learnings
- Built CI/CD automation using **Azure DevOps**.  
- Used **approvals and gates** for controlled deployments.  
- Applied **Azure Key Vault** for secret management.  
- Leveraged **Azure Monitor** and **Application Insights** for health tracking.  
- Implemented **Blob lifecycle policies** to optimize storage cost.  
- Created a **serverless login function** with Azure Function App.
